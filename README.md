All you have to do in order to run the project locally is to download the project Zip-file then rightclick index and press Open with live server.

In this project I used Framework to create the new "body" of the index HTML page.

    A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register
    A registered user may login
    A registered user may logout
    A registered user may update their avatar
    A registered user may view their total credit
    A registered user may create a Listing with a title, deadline date, media gallery and description
    A registered user may add a Bid to another userâ€™s Listing
    A registered user may view Bids made on a Listing
    An unregistered user may search through Listings

 A live version of the Project is ran with GitHub Pages

Underneath I have a Gantt chart I made to track what tasks I have done.
